# GM-ConvCNP
A novel hydrogeological modeling approach (GM-ConvCNP) based on convolutional conditional neural processes (ConvCNP), a meta-learning approach for dealing with stochastic processes. 

## Experimental requirements
Both the 2-D and 3-D GM-ConvCNP were developed in Python 3.8 with Pytorch 1.8.0, and all experiments were implemented on a workstation with an Intel Xeon Gold 5117 CPU, a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, and 64GB RAM memory.
